# Notes for Lecture

A couple of notes for everyone who would like to follow the lectures.  Nearly all of the materials will be done on the board.  We will selectively have slides and batches of coding but typically, we will do things on the board.  That means that these notes will generally be quite sparse, more so reminders for topics to cover rather than in-depth / exhaustive notes.  The place to get those exhaustive notes is in class :)

## Key Points

* What is the difference between a microcontroller and microprocessor?
* Compare / contrast: embedded device, IoT, CPS
* What is SWaP-C?
* Explain sensing vs. actuation.

## Agenda

* Introduction
* Syllabus
   * What are the pre-req skills?
   * General Course Structure - First Half vs. Second Half
* Course Project
   * Project proposal - Thursday before break
* Assignment 1 
   * Test / skill check
   * More than six hours - way too much
* Acronym Soup / Embedded System
